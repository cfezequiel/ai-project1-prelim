=====================================

Notes:
- The program was written in Python 2.7
- Thee program was tested on the following machines:
    * Ubuntu 11.10
    * Mac OSX Lion

Execution instructions:

1. Run the program itself.

    $ python astar.py <start city> <end city> [excluded city]

    The location and connection data is, by default, in the /input
    directory. The default location and connection files are:
        connections.txt
        locations.txt

    A different file for location and connection data can be specified
    by using the -l and -c options respectively.

    For help, execute the following:

    $ ./astar.py -h
    OR
    $ ./astar.py --help

2. Run the test.

    $ python test_astar.py

    Current, the test has just 3 test cases, where one test case
    checks the output when an excluded city is given in the program
    input.

    The output should be 'OK' on all tests.
